The program will continuosly query the log DB to check for orders that took more than x nanoseconds.

If there is at least one order that took more than x nanoseconds then prints an alert into stdout.
Else continue

How can I avoid rereading logs?
1. Read only those logs that were done after the last read time.
    -- save the last read time
    -- read the logs that were created after the last read time
